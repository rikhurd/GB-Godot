# My Godot Hobby Project

This is a **hobby project** developed using **Godot 4.x**.  
I switched from **Unreal Engine** because Godot allows **faster iteration** and its tools better fit the type of game I want to make.

## About

- This project is made for learning and experimentation.  
- I am using it to learn C# in Godot and to explore larger coding projects.  

## How to Run the Project

1. Make sure you have **Godot 4.x** (or the newest version) installed. You can download it from [Godot's official website](https://godotengine.org/download).  
2. Open Godot and select **"Open Project"**.  
3. Navigate to this project folder and open it.  
4. Press **Play** in the Godot editor to start the project.

## About the Game

This is going to be a tactical RPG with turn-based-ish combat and grid-like movement.


Expect frequent updates and experimental changes.
